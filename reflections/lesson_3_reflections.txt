When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository can be useful if you want to collaborate with others or simply publish your work for others to use.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have local changes that you are working on that have dependencies on other files in the repo. If Git auto-pulled from GitHub it might pull changes that were added by other contributors and may affect your work.
